      <hr />
      <p>
        At the close of 2022, buzz around the potential of large language model AI was growing fast, and Microsoft was
        at the center of it. The company had made a smart investment in <a id="tribute-link" href="https://openai.com/"
          target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, the company behind DALL-E and <a id="tribute-link"
          href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, and it would soon announce the integration of
        GPT-4 into its Bing search engine and Edge browser. Microsoft was also preparing to unveil the addition of
        Copilot to its suite of productivity applications. Copilot adds unprecedented new AI functionalities to its core
        product lines—based on a single text prompt written in conversational speech, the Word Copilot could write your
        first drafts; PowerPoint could generate your slides, Excel could analyze your quarterly sales results and
        highlight key trends.

        It would be one of the most significant developments in the world of business and work in years. It was also an
        opportunity for Microsoft to lay out its vision for the promise of AI. GDP was there to help the company
        formulate and articulate that vision.

      <p>This collaboration between Microsoft and GDP was the culmination of a partnership that began three years ago
        with the creation of the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/"
          target="_blank">WorkLab</a> platform, a place for the company to share research, hard data, and in-depth
        journalism about the future of work. It has continued through several seasons of a WorkLab podcast, a series of
        guides to help business leaders navigate the swiftly changing world of hybrid work, a newsletter, and scores of
        feature stories and in-depth reports that helped secure Microsoft the top spot on Fast Company’s list of “Most
        Innovative Data Science Companies”.</p>
